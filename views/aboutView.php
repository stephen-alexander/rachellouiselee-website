"I work intuitively with automatic drawing and writing through photography and printmaking. Proposing the imagination as layered landscapes thriving outwith the body's shell, I strive to draw parallels between the psyche and familiar environments. These surroundings, the outer body and the inner mind continuously interact in intuitive collaboration, as I touch upon the Surrealist conversation through this display of the subconscious in separate existence from the body's instrument. 
<br>
<br>
The interaction between the actual landscape and intuitively created landscapes is synchronized by the layering of lithography, screenprint and hand painted marks over digital images, as the boundaries between each process, as between reality and fantasy, is blurred."
